                <h2>About art</h2>
                <p>Abstract art has its origins in the 19th century. The period characterized by so vast a body of
                    elaborately representational art produced for the sake of illustrating anecdote also produced a
                    number of painters who examined the mechanism of light and visual perception. The period of
                    Romanticism had put forward ideas about art that denied classicism’s emphasis on imitation and
                    idealization and had instead stressed the role of imagination and of the unconscious as the
                    essential creative factors. Gradually many painters of this period began to accept the new freedom
                    and the new responsibilities implied in the coalescence of these attitudes. Maurice Denis’s
                    statement of 1890, “It should be remembered that a picture—before being a war-horse, a nude, or an
                    anecdote of some sort—is essentially a flat surface covered with colours assembled in a certain
                    order,” summarizes the feeling among the Symbolist and Postimpressionist artists of his time.</p>
                <p>All the major movements of the first two decades of the 20th century, including Fauvism,
                    Expressionism, Cubism, and Futurism, in some way emphasized the gap between art and natural
                    appearances.</p>
                <p>There is, however, a deep distinction between abstracting from appearances, even if to the point of
                    unrecognizability, and making works of art out of forms not drawn from the visible world. During the
                    four or five years preceding World War I, such artists as Robert Delaunay, Wassily Kandinsky,
                    Kazimir Malevich, and Vladimir Tatlin turned to fundamentally abstract art. (Kandinsky is generally
                    regarded as having been the first modern artist to paint purely abstract pictures containing no
                    recognizable objects, in 1910–11.) The majority of even the progressive artists regarded the
                    abandonment of every degree of representation with disfavour, however. During World War I the
                    emergence of the de Stijl group in the Netherlands and of the Dada group in Zürich further widened
                    the spectrum of abstract art.</p>

                                Apollinaire. The name comes from the musician Orpheus in ancient Greek myths, as
                                Apollinaire thought that painting should be like music. Main artists Robert Delaunay and
                                Sonia Delaunay also used the term simultanism to describe their work of this period.</p>

                            <p class="small">Inspired by Freud’s idea of free association (the desire to reveal the
                                unconscious mind), artists such as Joan Miro and Max Ernst created automatic paintings.
                                This free way of creating art led to simplified organic shapes, which Miro developed
                                into his own personal sign language.</p>

                                highly intense colour and non-naturalistic brushwork, often based on the artist’s inner
                                feelings. Kandinsky saw his abstract paintings as an alternative pathway to spiritual

                                meditational response in the viewer.</p>

                            <p class="small">Op art (1960s): Seen as a subdivision of post-painterly abstraction this
                                style of hard-edged geometric abstraction reacted to the more gestural forms of abstract
                                expressionism by only using monochromatic fields of clean-edged colour which reinforced

                            ever before on the basic elements of painting: form, colour, texture, scale, composition and
                            were ruthless in their rejection of mysticism and of any reference to the external world.
